# Bug Fixes - October 19, 2025

This document details all the bugs that were identified and fixed in this commit.

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Fixed D3.js Version Incompatibility ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**File:** `templates/wordcloud.html`

**Problem:** The application was loading D3.js v7 but using D3.js v3/v4 API syntax (`d3.layout.cloud()`), which caused the word cloud to completely fail to render.

**Fix:** Changed D3.js version from v7 to v4 for compatibility with the d3-cloud library.

```diff
- <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
+ <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```

**Impact:** Word cloud now renders correctly without JavaScript errors.

## Security Fixes

### 2. Fixed Debug Mode Security Vulnerability üîí HIGH

**File:** `app.py`

**Problem:** Flask app was running with `debug=True` hardcoded, which exposes sensitive information and security vulnerabilities in production.

**Fix:** Changed to use environment variable with safe default.

```diff
- app.run(debug=True)
+ app.run(debug=os.getenv('FLASK_DEBUG', 'False').lower() == 'true')
```

**Impact:** Debug mode is now disabled by default and can only be enabled via environment variable.

### 3. Fixed XSS Vulnerability in Tweet Display üîí HIGH

**File:** `static/script.js`

**Problem:** Tweet text was being inserted directly into HTML using template literals, which could allow XSS attacks if tweets contained malicious HTML/JavaScript.

**Fix:** Refactored to use DOM methods with `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` for user-generated content.

```javascript
// Before: Vulnerable to XSS
li.innerHTML = `<p>${tweet.text}</p>`;

// After: Safe from XSS
const tweetText = document.createElement('p');
tweetText.textContent = tweet.text; // textContent escapes HTML
tweetContent.appendChild(tweetText);
```

**Impact:** Application is now protected against XSS attacks through tweet content.

---

## API & Deprecation Fixes

### 4. Replaced Deprecated `document.execCommand()` üì± MEDIUM

**File:** `static/script.js` (2 locations)

**Problem:** Using deprecated `document.execCommand('copy')` which may be removed from browsers.

**Fix:** Replaced with modern Clipboard API with fallback for older browsers.

```javascript
// Modern approach with fallback
navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href)
    .then(() => {
        // Success feedback
    })
    .catch(err => {
        // Fallback to execCommand for older browsers
        console.error('Failed to copy:', err);
        // ... fallback code
    });
```

**Impact:** Copy functionality now uses modern API and is future-proof.

---

### 5. Added Null Safety for Tweet Metrics üõ°Ô∏è MEDIUM

**File:** `static/script.js`

**Problem:** Code assumed `tweet.metrics` always exists, which could cause runtime errors if API returns incomplete data.

**Fix:** Added null safety check before accessing metrics.

```javascript
// Before: Could throw error if metrics is undefined
tweet.metrics.retweet_count || 0

// After: Safe with fallback
const metrics = tweet.metrics || {};
metrics.retweet_count || 0
```

**Impact:** Application handles incomplete API responses gracefully without errors.

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### 6. Added Log File Rotation üìù LOW

**File:** `app.py`

**Problem:** Logs were written to `app.log` without rotation, which would cause the file to grow indefinitely and potentially fill up disk space.

**Fix:** Implemented `RotatingFileHandler` with 10MB max file size and 5 backup files.

```python
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler

log_handler = RotatingFileHandler('app.log', maxBytes=10485760, backupCount=5)
```

**Impact:** Log files now rotate automatically, preventing disk space issues.

---

### 7. Removed Unused Import üßπ NEGLIGIBLE

**File:** `app.py`

**Problem:** `time` module was imported but never used.

**Fix:** Removed the unused import.

```diff
- import time
```

**Impact:** Cleaner code, slightly faster imports.

---

### 8. Fixed Secret Key Generation üîß LOW

**File:** `app.py`

**Problem:** `os.urandom(24)` returns bytes, but Flask SECRET_KEY should be a string for consistency.

**Fix:** Added `.hex()` to convert bytes to string.

```diff
- app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', os.urandom(24))
+ app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', os.urandom(24).hex())
```

**Impact:** More consistent and proper secret key handling.

## Testing Recommendations

After deploying these fixes:

1. ‚úÖ Verify word cloud renders correctly
2. ‚úÖ Test copy-to-clipboard functionality
3. ‚úÖ Test tweet display with various content
4. ‚úÖ Verify debug mode is disabled in production
5. ‚úÖ Check log file rotation after reaching 10MB

---

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file for development:

```env
FLASK_DEBUG=true  # Only for local development, never in production
```
